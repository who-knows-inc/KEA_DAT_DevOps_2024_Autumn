# Telemetry vs. Monitoring

**Telemetry**: Data collection and transmission (sending data from one location to another)

**Monitoring**: Data analysis, visualization, and alerting based on telemetry data

---

# Telemetry Levels


| Level                      | Examples                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business level**         | Sales transactions, revenue, user sign-ups, churn rate, A/B test results                  |
| **Application level**      | Transaction durations, response times, application errors                                  |
| **Infrastructure level**   | Server traffic, CPU load, disk usage, network latency                                     |
| **End-user experience level** | App crashes, client-side response times, user-measured performance                      |
| **Deployment pipeline level** | Build status, deployment lead times, frequency, environment health                      |
| **Security level**         | Failed logins, unauthorized access, data access patterns                                  |

# Observability-Driven Development (ODD)

> "If Engineering at Etsy has a religion, it’s the Church of Graphs. If it moves, we track it. Sometimes we’ll draw a graph of something that isn’t moving yet, just in case it decides to make a run for it...  Tracking everything is key to moving fast, but the only way to do it is to make tracking anything easy..."

\- Ian Malpass, Engineer at Etsy

# Reminder: Observability is not a substitute to testing!

Incidents in production are costly and hard to debug

# What is monitoring?

> "Monitoring is for asking questions."

— Dave Josephsen, Monitorama 2016

**Point**: It's not just about the health of the system. We want to adhere to a DevOps principle of **continuous learning**/**improving**.

# Monitoring vs. Logging

While logging is about recording individual events, monitoring is about observing the system.

Monitoring aggregates numerical data over time from various events. 

* Number of HTTP requests processed.

* The total time spent processing requests.

* The number of requests being handled concurrently.

* The number of errors encountered.

* CPU, memory, and disk usage.

# Types of monitoring

| Type                   | Description                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Health monitoring**  | Checks if the system is up and running.                    |
| **Performance monitoring** | Checks the performance of the system.                  |
| **Alerting**           | Notifies the team when something goes wrong.               |
| **Tracing**            | Tracks the flow of a request through the system.           |
| **Profiling**          | Measures the performance of the system.                    |
| **Auditing**           | Checks the system for compliance with security policies.   |
| **Business monitoring** | Checks the system for compliance with business policies.  |

# Pull versus Push Monitoring

## Pull/polling-based

The monitoring system actively queries (or “pulls”) metrics from monitored sub-systems.

Example: Prometheus is pull-based monitoring system that scrapes metrics from application endpoints at regular intervals. 

## Push-based

Hosts, services, and applications send (or “push”) metrics to a central monitoring collector.

Example: Graphite, certain setups of Nagios

# Why **NOT** - quote

> "Monitoring is so important that our monitoring systems need to be more available and scalable than the systems being monitored"

# Monitoring the business

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) asks question such as:

* Are the numbers of active users growing, declining, or stagnant?
* Are the users happy?
* Can we/are we making money?
* Are we profitable?

Resulting in metrics such as:

* Net promoter score (likelyhood of a customer recommending your product)
* Revenue per customer
* Cost per customer
* Burn rate (how fast money is spent)

One could record user interactions with the the website to discover what hinders them from completing a flow.

# Beware: Alert fatigue 

> "That is, monitoring doesn’t exist to generate alerts: alerts are just one possible outcome. With this in mind, remember that every metric you collect and graph does not need to have a corresponding alert."

\-  Mike Julian, Practical Monitoring, 2017

> "When deciding whether a message should be ERROR or WARN, imagine being woken up at 4 AM. Low printer toner is not an ERROR."

\- Dan North, While working at ThoughtWorks in 2006. 

(He coined the term BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) and helped to develop the early ideas behind DevOps.)

# Monitoring should not be reacting to symptoms

Monitoring should be used to predict and prevent issues.
