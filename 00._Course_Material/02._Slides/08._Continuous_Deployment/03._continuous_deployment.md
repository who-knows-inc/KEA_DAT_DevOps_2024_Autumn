# Quick recap of CI/CD/CD definitions

# Quote from the Github Skills course: Deploy To Azure

> A lot of things go into delivering "continuously". These things can range from culture and behavior to specific automation. In this exercise, we're going to focus on the deployment part of our automation.

# Types of deployment exemplified with the Flask app

#### Code on the server

1. `git pull` -> `python app.py` / `gunicon app:app` (gunicorn is preferred in production)

2. `git pull` -> `docker compose`

#### Codebase never touches the server

3. Use the server as a runner agent. 

4. `docker pull <image>` -> `docker run <image>`

5. `scp` the docker-compose file onto the server -> `docker-compose pull` / `docker-compose up`

# Remember to architect your pipeline for reduced runtime

You will be evaluated at the exam for how you construct your pipelines. 

One of the goals is to reduce the runtime of the pipeline.

You should also have quality gates in place.

---


# Quality Gates

```yaml
name: CI/CD with a security gate

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security-tests:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: security-tests

    steps:
    - name: Security Testing
      run: |
        echo "Running security tests..."
      if: success()

    steps:
    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
      if: success()
```

---

# Multiple quality gates

*How would you achieve that a job only runs if job A and job B are successful?*

---

# Multiple jobs acting as quality gates

```yaml
name: CI/CD with a security gate

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Security Testing
      run: |
        echo "Running security tests..."

  build-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Build and Run Tests
      run: |
        echo "Building and running tests..."

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [security-tests, build-tests]

    steps:
    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
```

---

# Run a workflow after another workflow

```yaml
name: Post-Test Workflow

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Test Workflow"]
    types:
      - completed
```

---

# Rollback

When we talk about pipelines we often describe them from left to right. 

But one important aspect is to ensure the quick ability to rollback. 

Now that we've looked at CI/CD in its enterity:

*Discuss: How can we rollback changes during every step of the process?*

Steps: Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continous Deployment.

# GitHub

<blockquote style="font-size: medium;">
  We are constantly deploying at GitHub. Dozens of times a day.  
  <br><br>
  Any employee can deploy to production from Campfire with a single message. When someone pushes to master, after watching the tests pass, they're encouraged to immediately deploy to production. This way, everyone is responsible for their own code being production-ready, and people don't have to worry about pushing someone else's code and breaking production.  
  <br><br>
  Recently, this process got even better. Now, after someone pushes to master and the tests pass, master is deployed to production automatically. We have ways of preventing this from happening (an employee can temporarily lock deployment while they're collecting data, for example), but by default, production is always up-to-date with master.  
  <br><br>
  This is a fantastic way of doing things. Deploying constantly means we completely avoid giant scary "deployment days", and our fast and painless deployment process means we can quickly fix problems as they're discovered.

# Facebook

Facebook in 2012 deploys:

* One minor update on most business days

* One major update on a weekly basis, usually Tuesdays

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering/

Facebook since 2016 deploys:

* quasi-continuous deployment from master

* rolled out to 100 percent of production in a tiered fashion over a few hours
