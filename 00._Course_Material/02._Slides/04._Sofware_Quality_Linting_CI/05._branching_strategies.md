# Branching strategies

Why? To allow agile teams to collaborate. Branching strategies is an agreement on how agile teams collaborate and create production-ready releases.

Note: The past couple of years there has been an influx of new and shiny branching strategies that everyone suddenly *must* follow. This should give a clue that branching is a problem with no perfect solution.

# Branching strategies 

- **Feature Branching**: Each feature is developed in a separate branch.

- **Trunk-based Development**: All developers merge their changes to the trunk multiple times a day.  

- **Release Branching**: A branch is created for each release.

- **Gitflow**: A branching model that uses master, develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches.

- **GitHub Flow**: Adds the concept of Pull Requests and Github Discussions before merging with main.
