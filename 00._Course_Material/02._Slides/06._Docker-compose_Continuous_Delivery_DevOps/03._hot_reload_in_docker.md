# Hot-reload

Java: `jrebel`

Node.js: `nodemon`

Python frameworks usually have hot-reload built-in but nodemon works well to run Python code in Docker in development. 

**Problem**: Docker makes it harder to achieve hot-reload.  

**Goal**: Improve the development experience by automatically reloading the application when the code changes.

# Continuing from last week

We have a folder containing a subfolder called `node_project` with a `package.json` file and an `app.js` file.

Express has been installed as a dependency and `app.js` contains a simple Express server.

---

# Nodemon with Docker example

Create a `Dockerfile.dev` file:

```Dockerfile
FROM node

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Install nodemon globally
RUN npm install -g nodemon

COPY . .

CMD npm config set cache-min 9999999 && nodemon app.js
```

---

# Docker-compose.dev.yml

Create a docker-compose file outside of `node_project`. This allows for a nicer separation from the server if we create more services later on. 

The docker-compose file allows us to define volumes which is necessary for caching the `node_modules` folder:

```Dockerfile
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./node_project
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./node_project:/usr/src/app
      - backend_node_modules:/usr/src/app/node_modules

volumes:
  backend_node_modules:
```

---

# Running the setup

Where the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file is located:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Try to make a change in `app.js` and see the magic happen.
