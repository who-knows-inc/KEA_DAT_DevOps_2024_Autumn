# Exam requirements

This document is a list of the pure requirements described in a way that allows you to choose other technologies.

You must have all your group data filled out in the `repositories.py` file. This must be done exactly when you are asked to do it in the course preparation.

---

## Meta-requirement: Group work

Everyone should be involved and participate in the project weekly.

I will run a script to assert that everyone has contributed. This is for people who aren't participating much in their group. This isn't a measuring contest. We are just trying to create a fair landscape of who did nothing in the group.

The graphs will also help us spot anomalies such as unbalanced work effort throughout the semester. So please avoid last-minute cramming. The course tries to coexist with other electives.

## Tech stack

The server must be rewritten in another framework. You are not allowed to use `Flask`, `Express` or `Spring Boot`.

---

## Organization

Use version control.

Employ a branching strategy.

Have a way to manage issues.

---

## Code quality

Ensure code quality (static analysis / linting).

You must perform testing.

---

## Automation

Use a CI pipeline.

If you don't have a CD pipeline, you must have a plan for how you would automate deployment.

---

## Deployment

Your application must be deployed to a Virtual Machine or similar. Services like Web Apps or PaaS like Vercel etc. are great and easy to use, but it removes your chance to learn and reach the course goals.

While not required to implement it, you must've discussed scaling and an optimal deployment strategy in your groups.

---

## Production

Your system should be deployed for the exam.

---

## Monitoring

You must have monitoring.

---

## Documentation

To your best ability, create thorough documentation.

---

## Learning goals

The learning goals are designed to help you understand at what level you should know the content.

While the general content of the slides is mandatory knowledge, sources and external links (included in the slides) are not required reading unless explicitly mentioned in the semester plan.

---

## Use of language models

This course encourages you to use tools that might aid you in coding, debugging and correctly configuring your systems.

However, do **not** use AI to write the report. Even with proper prompting language models don't seem to be able to write in the concise manner required without losing meaning. The report is an excercise in trying to formulate the subject in a way that forces you to cut down to the heart of the subjects and what matters in this course.
