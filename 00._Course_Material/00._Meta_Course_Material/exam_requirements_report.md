# Exam report requirements

The exam report is written by the group and will be read by me and the censor. 

## Requirements

**Deadline**: Since hand-in is over Wiseflow, check there to see when the deadline has been set. I do not control this.

**Length**: Max 8 pages

**Language**: Danish/English

## Report formalities

Include: 

- Group name and student names with kea mail

- Page numbers

**Justify margins**: The entire report text (except titles) must be justified on both sides. To get you started, here is how you can do it in Google Docs and Word:

Justifying text helps readability and gives the report a professional look. 

## Sections to include

Since the mandatories specify a set of documents that you must bring to the exam, it would be interesting to allow you complete freedom for the exam report. 

Giving an overview of the setup with diagram(s) is a good start, though.

My advice: Keep it concise!
